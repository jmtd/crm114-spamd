This is a small server that is supposed to run from (x)inetd.
It accepts a connection, and then reads a command in the spamd protocol as
specified on http://spamassassin.apache.org/full/3.0.x/dist/spamd/PROTOCOL.

Currently, it only handles the REPORT query, but adding support for others
should be straight-forward.

It will
 - report 0 score if dspam determines the message to not be spam,
   and report that it is not spam
 - report 10*probability if dspam determines the message to be spam,
   and report that it is spam
 - always set the points required to 0
 - setuid() to the user given in the User: header line in the protocol
 - set the dspam mode to the mode given as in the User: header line
   (for these two, the User: header line looks like this:
     User: username mode
   where the mode is optional)

Due to the way the points are calculated, you probably never want to use the
spam/not-spam verdict of this tool to make an automatic decision but rather
go from the points.

It only handles messages smaller than 5mb!
