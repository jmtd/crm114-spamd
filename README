This is a small server that is supposed to run from (x)inetd.
It accepts a connection, and then reads a command in the spamd protocol as
specified on http://spamassassin.apache.org/full/3.0.x/dist/spamd/PROTOCOL.

Currently, it only handles the REPORT query, but adding support for others
should be straight-forward.

It was only written to integrate crm114 into exim and hence has a very
small feature set and doesn't exactly implement the spamd protocol
perfectly, relies on exact upper/lowercasing of input etc. Hence, it is
most likely not suited for use in places other than exim calling it.

Here's an example use in an exim acl:

/----------
| warn
|   set acl_m_spam_score_int = 0
|
| warn
|   # condition = size restriction!
|   spam = ${local_part}/defer_ok
|   set acl_m_spam_score_int = $spam_score_int
|
| deny
|   condition = ${if >{$acl_m_spam_score_int}{300}}
|   message = We determined that your message is spam.
\-----

It will currently
 - if two command line arguments are given, chdir() to the second one
 - setuid() to the user given in the User: header line in the protocol
 - call the binary specified by the first command line argument with the
   '--report_only' option
 - report "-score" (from the crm114 status) and SPAM/GOOD/UNSURE depending
   on what mailreaver thinks of the message.
 - output "spam threshold" zero (regardless of the crm114 settings)

Due to the way the points are calculated, you probably never want to use the
spam/not-spam verdict of this tool to make an automatic decision but rather
go from the points as in the example above.

NOTE: crm114 is only capable of handling messages smaller than around 8 MB
      unless you use a wrapper that passes the -w flag, hence make sure that
      you don't pass larger messages.
